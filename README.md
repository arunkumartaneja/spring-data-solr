# Solr introduction

Apache Solr is an enterprise-capable, open source search platform based on the Apache Lucene search library. The Solr search engine is one of the most widely deployed 
search platforms worldwide.

It's major features include full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, real-time indexing, dynamic clustering, database integration, NoSQL features and rich document
(e.g., Word, PDF) handling

Solr runs as a standalone full-text search server. It uses the Lucene Java search library at its core for full-text indexing and search, and has REST-like HTTP/XML and JSON APIs
that make it usable from most popular programming languages
